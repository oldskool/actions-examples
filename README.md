GitHub Actions Examples
---

This repository holds several examples of GitHub Actions workflows that you can use in your repository.
Feel free to copy any of the workflows that you find here and adjust it to your own needs.

If you need any help with GitHub Actions workflows, head over to the
[GitHub Community Forum](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/bd-p/actions).

## Contributing

If you spot a mistake in one of the workflows or know of a way to optimize it, feel free to submit a PR.
Also if you have a re-usable workflow that you want to share, feel free to submit it as a PR.
Any changes that you made to a workflow found here for your specific situation will not be accepted,
since the idea is to have general examples, rather than tailor-made ones.
